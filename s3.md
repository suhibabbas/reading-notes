### Strong consistency

## How Amazon S3 works

Amazon S3 is an object storage service that stores data as objects within buckets.

to store your data in Amazon S3:

1. create a bucket and specify a bucket name and AWS Region.
2. upload your data to that bucket as objects in Amazon S3.

Buckets and the objects in them are private and can be accessed only if you explicitly grant access permissions.

### Buckets

A bucket is a container for objects stored in Amazon S3.

you can have up to 100 buckets in your account.

### Objects

Objects are the fundamental entities stored in Amazon S3.

The metadata is a set of name-value pairs that describe the object.

### Keys

An object key (or key name) is the unique identifier for an object within a bucket.

### S3 Versioning

You can use S3 Versioning to keep multiple variants of an object in the same bucket. 

### Version ID

When you enable S3 Versioning in a bucket, Amazon S3 generates a unique version ID for each object added to the bucket.

### S3 Access Points

Amazon S3 Access Points are named network endpoints with dedicated access policies that describe how data can be accessed using that endpoint.

### Access control lists (ACLs)

You can use ACLs to grant read and write permissions to authorized users for individual buckets and objects.

### Regions

You can choose the geographical AWS Region where Amazon S3 stores the buckets that you create.
