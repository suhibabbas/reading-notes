# Big(O)

it's used to describ the efficiency of an algorithm or function. This efficiency is evaluated based on 2 factors:

1. Running Time (also known as time efficiency / complexity)

2. Memory Space (also known as space efficiency / complexity)

it's to describe the **Worst Case** of efficiency an algorithm can have in performing it’s job.

There are **4 Key Areas** for analysis:

1. Input Size
2. Units of Measurement
3. Orders of Growth
4. Best Case, Worst Case, and Average Case

## Input Size

it's affected by the parameter values that are read by the algorithm not the number of parameters but the size of each parameter value.\
The higher this number, the more likely there will be an increase to Running Time and Memory Space.

## Units of Measurement

**In order to quantify the Running Time in our analysis, we will consider Three Measurements of time:**

1. The time in **milliseconds** from the start of a function execution until it ends.
2. The number of **operations** that are executed.
3.The number of **“Basic Operations”** that are executed.

**In order to quantify Memory Space, we can consider Four Sources of Memory Usage during function run-time:**

1. The amount of space needed to hold the **code for the algorithm.**
2. The amount of space needed to hold the **input** data.
3. The amount of space needed for the **output** data.
4. The amount of space needed to hold **working space** during the calculation.

For modern computer, algorithm space complexity is not as much of a concern as it used to be.
