**The key ideas behind deliberate practice is that it:**

- Repeated often.
- Feedback on results in continuously available.
- It's highly demanding mentally.
- It's difficult.

The power of 'NOT YET' that means I still can do it even if I failed, I still have a chance to reach my goals.


## Emotional Intelligence

Looks like I should work on improving my emotional intelligence.\
I seem to lack many things that help me understand myself, such as not thinking about the emotions behind my actions, I also cannot understand other people's feelings easily or without them telling me

## Assessing Bias
It seems like I still need to develop myself a bit, especially in some areas eg "EMPATHY AND CURIOSITY" and I hope I can do it.
