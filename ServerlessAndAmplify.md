# Serverless and Amplify

Serverless is a cloud computing execution model where the cloud provider dynamically manages the allocation and provisioning of servers.

Serverless applications are event-driven cloud-based systems where application development rely solely on a combination of third-party services, client-side logic and cloud-hosted remote procedure calls (Functions as a Service).

the most used cloud services:

- AWS Lambda
- Google Cloud Functions
- Azure Functions
- IBM OpenWhisk
- Alibaba Function Compute
- Iron Functions
- Auth0 Webtask
- Oracle Fn Project
- Kubeless

the cloud computing considered less expensive than the traditional one, but i the traditional you can access it more easily, the cloud afford to you some of the 3rd party dependencies while in traditional you can add what you need, in serverless you can set up different environments easily and that would be hard in traditional and there are so many other differences.
