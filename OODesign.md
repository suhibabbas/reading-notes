# OO Design

## Don't repeat youtself (DRY)

DRY is a principle of software development aimed at reducing repetition of software patterns,[1] replacing it with abstractions or using data normalization to avoid redundancy.

the principle has been formulated by **Andy Hun**t and **Dave Thomas** They apply it quite broadly to include "database schemas, test plans, the build system, even documentation".

### Alternatives

WET: Write everything twice.
AHA: avoid hasty abstractions.

## Rule of three

A rule to decide when similar pieces of code should be refactored to avoid duplication. The rule war popularised by **Martin Fowler**.

However, choosing an appropriate design to avoid duplication might benefit from more examples to see patterns in. Attempting premature refactoring risks selecting a wrong abstraction, which can result in worse code as new requirements emerge[2] and will eventually need to be refactored again.

## You aren't gonna need it

Is a principle which arose from extreme programming (XP) that states a programmer should not add functionality until deemed necessary.XP co-founder Ron Jeffries has written: "Always implement things when you actually need them, never when you just foresee that you need them."[5] Other forms of the phrase include "You aren't going to need it" (YAGTNI) [6][7] and "You ain't gonna need it" (YAGNI).

## Minimum viable product

Is a version of a product with just enough features to be usable by early customers who can then provide feedback for future product development.

**Purpses:**

    - Be able to test a product hypothesis with minimal resources
    - Accelerate learning
    - Reduce wasted engineering hours
    - Get the product to early customers as soon as possible
    - Base for other products
    - To establish a builder's abilities in crafting the product required
    - Brand building very quickly

**Testing**
    Testing is the essence of minimum viable products. As described above, an MVP seeks to test out whether an idea works in market environments while using the least possible expenditure

**Notable quotes**
     "Youâ€™re selling the vision and delivering the minimum feature set to visionaries, not everyone
